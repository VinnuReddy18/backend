# Backend Documentation

## Overview

The backend of this project is built using Node.js and Express. Its primary role is to serve API endpoints that provide data to the frontend. The main components of the backend are:

1. **Server Setup (`index.js`)**: This file sets up the server, configures middleware, and defines the API routes.
2. **Route Handler (`routes/data.js`)**: This file handles the `/api/data` endpoint, fetching data from a JSON file.
3. **Data File (`data.json`)**: This file contains the data served by the API.

## Files and Directories

### `index.js`

**Purpose:**

The `index.js` file is the entry point of the backend application. It initializes the Express server, sets up necessary middleware, and defines routes.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Server Initialization**: Sets up the Express server to listen on a specified port.
- **Middleware Configuration**: Configures middleware to parse JSON request bodies.
- **Route Definition**: Links the route handler for the `/api/data` endpoint.

### `routes/data.js`

**Purpose:**

The `routes/data.js` file handles requests to the `/api/data` endpoint. It reads data from the `data.json` file and returns it as a JSON response.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Data Reading**: Reads data from `data.json`.
- **Response Handling**: Sends the data as a JSON response to the client.
- **Error Handling**: Catches and logs errors, returning a 500 status code in case of server errors.

### `data.json`

**Purpose:**

The `data.json` file stores the data served by the API. It is structured as a JSON array of objects, each containing fields such as `name`, `version`, and `language`.

**Sample Structure:**

- **name**: The name of the item.
- **version**: The version of the item.
- **language**: The language associated with the item.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure all required dependencies are installed by running the following command in the `backend` directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Backend Server

To start the backend server, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```sh
npm start
```

### 3. Access the API

The backend server will run at `http://localhost:5000`. The data can be accessed via the `/api/data` endpoint:

```sh
http://localhost:5000/api/data
```

## Notes

- **Data File Location**: Ensure that the `data.json` file is correctly located and accessible by the server.
- **Error Handling**: Check server logs for detailed error messages if any issues arise.
- **Customization**: For further customization, refer to the relevant backend files and adjust them as needed.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the backend setup, including its main components and their responsibilities. Follow the setup instructions to get the backend server running, and refer to the notes section for troubleshooting and customization tips.
